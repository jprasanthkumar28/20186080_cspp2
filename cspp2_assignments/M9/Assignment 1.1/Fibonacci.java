/**
 * In the previous module you have created List ADT. ADTs are developed as
 * reusable libraries i.e., anyone who needs the ADT can use it in their program
 * A program that uses the ADT is called a "client" of the ADT The client
 * typically instantiates an object of the ADT and invokes the public methods on
 * the ADT object.
 *
 * This assignment is to practice the idea of client to the ADT. Client class is
 * Fibonacci and the client needs to use the List ADT to store fibonacci numbers
 * in the List ADT. So, Fibonacci is going to instantiate an object of List ADT
 * generate fibonacci numbers and add them to the list by invoking the add
 * method provided in the List ADT.
